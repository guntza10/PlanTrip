## Draft 1

Sure, I can recommend a 7-day trip to Fukuoka for you! Fukuoka is a vibrant city located in southern Japan that has a lot to offer visitors. Here's a suggested itinerary that covers some of the best things to see and do in and around Fukuoka:

Assuming you'll be arriving in Fukuoka in the afternoon, take some time to settle in and explore the Hakata area around the train station. Hakata is known for its bustling streets filled with shops and restaurants. You can also visit the nearby Kushida Shrine, a beautiful Shinto shrine with a traditional Japanese garden.

Day 2: Fukuoka Tower and Ohori Park

Start your day by visiting the Fukuoka Tower, a 234-meter-tall observation tower with stunning views of the city and the sea. Afterward, head to Ohori Park, a beautiful park with a large pond, gardens, and walking paths. You can rent a paddleboat or take a stroll through the park's Japanese garden.

Day 3: Dazaifu and Yanagawa

Today, take a day trip to the nearby towns of Dazaifu and Yanagawa. Dazaifu is known for its beautiful shrine and gardens, while Yanagawa is famous for its picturesque canals and boat tours. You can take a train from Hakata Station to Dazaifu and then a bus to Yanagawa.

Day 4: Nokonoshima Island

Today, take a ferry from Hakata Port to Nokonoshima Island, a small island located just off the coast of Fukuoka. The island is known for its beautiful beaches, hiking trails, and flower gardens. You can rent a bicycle to explore the island or take a dip in the crystal-clear waters.

Day 5: Fukuoka Castle and Canal City Hakata

On your last day in Fukuoka, visit the Fukuoka City Museum, a museum dedicated to the city's history and culture. Afterward, head to Tenjin, a bustling area of the city known for its shopping and dining. You can stroll through the streets and sample some of the local cuisine before departing Fukuoka.

As for special events or places to visit during your trip, Fukuoka is known for its festivals, so check if any festivals are taking place during your visit. In March, you can check out the Fukuoka Cherry Blossom Festival, which takes place in various locations throughout the city.
